## Description

This project is a compiler written primarily in C++ with some C and Makefile components. The purpose of this compiler is to translate source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code.

---

## Language Composition

- **C++:** 96.4%
- **C:** 2.4%
- **Makefile:** 1.2%

---

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis:** Tokenizes the source code.
- **Syntax Analysis:** Parses tokens to ensure grammatical correctness.
- **Semantic Analysis:** Checks for semantic errors.
- **Intermediate Code Generation:** Generates intermediate code for optimization.
- **Code Optimization:** Optimizes the intermediate code.
- **Code Generation:** Generates machine code from the optimized code.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis:** Tokenizes the source code.
- **Syntax Analysis:** Parses tokens to ensure grammatical correctness.
- **Semantic Analysis:** Checks for semantic errors.
- **Intermediate Code Generation:** Generates intermediate code for optimization.
- **Code Optimization:** Optimizes the intermediate code.
- **Code Generation:** Generates machine code from the optimized code.
